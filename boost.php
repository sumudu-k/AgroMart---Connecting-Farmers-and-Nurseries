    <h3>Ad Boosting Policy</h3>
    <p>Boosting an ad costs 200 LKR. This process highlights your ad, increasing its visibility to potential buyers.
        Please note that this action cannot be undone once confirmed. Ensure all ad details are accurate before
        proceeding with the boost.</p>
    <p>Boosted ads will remain highlighted for a period of 7 days, after which they will return to their normal
        visibility status. No refunds will be provided for boosted ads under any circumstances.</p>
